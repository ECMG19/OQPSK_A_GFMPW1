**OQPSK Modulator in Verilog**

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of an OQPSK (Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulator, developed at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) in Mexico, Guadalajara Unit.

**Description:**

The OQPSK modulator is a crucial component in digital communication systems. It employs the OQPSK modulation technique to transmit data efficiently and reliably. The OQPSK modulation scheme involves a two-stage phase shift, helping minimize the probability of errors and enhancing system robustness against adverse channel conditions.

**Key Features:**

- Verilog implementation for use in FPGA and ASIC devices.
- Designed for advanced digital communication systems.
- Developed at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the IPN in Mexico, Guadalajara Unit.
